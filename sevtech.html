    <p>Come join us on the Sevtech server! Running 24/7, feel free to join at any time.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>How to Join</h3>
    <p>1. Download <a href="https://multimc.org/#Download" target="_blank">MultiMC</a>. Download the version you need for your system.
      <br>2. Once installed, open MultiMC and click on "Add Instance". Select ATLauncher and then find Sevtech Ages. Make sure the 
      version is 3.2.3 in the bottom right, then select ok.
      <br>3.Once the instance is added, you'll need to log into your account. Click at the top right and select manage accounts. 
      You can either add a Microsoft or Mojang account, depending on what you have. You can ask one of us for an account if you don't have one, we have a few extra shared.
      <br>4.Now you can launch Sevtech Ages. It will take a while to load, so go get a snack or check out some of the other games on this site.
      Once you are in, select multiplayer and add a server. The IP is 71.61.249.163. Now you can join the server and explore!
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Trouble shooting</h3>
    <p>Failed to launch into loading screen:
      <br>Its likely using the wrong version of Java. You'll want to install 
      <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp" target="_blank">Java 8</a>. Once installed, select "Settings" at the top and click Java. 
      Click auto-detect and it should give you options. You'll want to select version 1.8.0_xxx. Click ok and try launching again. (While you are here, 
      you might want to check that the program has enough RAM)
      <br>
      <br>Frequent Crashes:
      <br>Try giving the program more RAM. Select "Settings" from the top and select Java. How much RAM your computer has will limit how much you can allocate. 
      My minimum is set to 8192 MiB and I haven't had any issues. Most computers have at least 16GB of RAM so this should be fine. If you need more RAM, contact 
      Terrance on discord at Shadowfury#5775 and ask him if you can borrow some. Do not mention the wagon, it upsets him.
