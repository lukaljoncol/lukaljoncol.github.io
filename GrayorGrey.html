                The question of the correct spelling of grey/ay has been debated for centuries. What many people fail to realize is that
                this grey/ay area of spelling is often used as a subliminal message by the government to show allegiance to the speaker's mother country
                country. In America, land of sheep, the term for a slightly blacker white is spelled gray with an "A". In England it is spelled grey.

                Do you see the relationship? America has brainwashes it's citizens by using an "A" to spell grey/ay and England uses an "E". This is
                because America shook the chains bestowed upon her(or him) by the British and the change of spelling was to officially symobolize
                the split. It also would convince future generations that "A" is better than "E". Still
                not convinced? Think that countries only spell grey/ay with the first letter of their name all the time? You'd be wrong. Australia
                spells blacker white with an "E". This is because Australia has never shaken the ties of british rule and is still being
                brainwashed to believe in England.

                The U.S. Government has also removed the "U" from color (previously known as colour). This has psychologically convinced
                Americans that they can do everything themselves. Now you may think to yourself that removing letters doesn't have a major
                effect, but have you ever thought about how much you type or read? With our world becoming more online based more people than
                ever have started reading text online, causing the effect of removing letters to increase exponentially.

                With subliminal use of letters in words the government can more efficiently work with aliens in controlling the
                 population and convincing them of ideas of partriotism that keep the world seperated and stop us from rising up against
                 a common enemy. Please share this link with 10 people to spread the message so we can more effectively combat this
                 ever growing problem.
