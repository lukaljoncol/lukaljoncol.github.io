        <h1>The Story</h1>
        <p>Jonny went to the ToysRUs and bought a robot on clearance. Jonny was very excited and wanted to show his new robot, 
        Karen to his family. Oakley, Jonny's dog, had never seen anything like Karen before and would hide anytime he heard
        Karen. Jonny tried many different things to get Oakley to like Karen, but Oakley just got annoyed and eventually would lay around
        till Karen got close and then he would get up and move. On one specific occasion, Oakley was laying on his bed when Jonny starts 
        driving Karen towards him. The angle of elevation from Oakley to the top of Karen is 15 degrees 3 minutes and 15.54 seconds. Oakley 
        knows that Karen is 39 inches tall. He also notes Karen is moving at her top speed of 0.341 mph. If Oakley takes 1.7 seconds to get up, 
        how long can he lay down before he has to move?
