            <p>
                Many people instantly think that Flat Earth is a joke and there is undeniable proof that the Earth is a globe.
                I'm not going to tell you that you are wrong since I believe that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I 
                do hope you stay and read this article before making a hateful comment in the comment section below.

                I get it. There are a lot of pictures of space and models of the solar system that
                make sense. I won’t argue with you here because you are right. If the entire universe
                was just like our education system says then all would be well. But the education
                system is where the idea of a globe falls apart.
            </p>
            <p>
                The education system teaches us about a world that is round and an elaborate
                solar system bound together by a gravitational force. This is what we are told
                when we were young therefore we interpret it as fact. No one challenges old
                concepts because it is unpopular and supporting evidence is accepted much faster.
                No one is taught to question ideas with overwhelming evidence because the evidence
                makes it true. Many people forget that any theory can be proven wrong with one 
                one experiment even if it has evidence supporting it. It there was no evidence
                to support a theory then no one would ever come up with the theory in the first place.
                Our education system needs to teach our kids that everything can be questioned and
                there is nothing wrong with having a belief as long as you have the evidence to back 
                it up. 
            </p>

                However, it is to late for our generation. We were taught to accept information
                from credible sources and to not challenge their ideas. This is why many people credit
                NASA’s photos as proof. We are not going to challenge these photos because we cannot 
                disprove them easily. Few people have taken the time to investigate NASA’s proof 
                and they have claimed to find evidence to disprove NASA's photos and videos. (link to channeleas).

            <p>
                You may think to yourself why would anyone lie about the shape of the Earth? It has little to 
                no effect on our everday lives. The reason for such a pointless lie is because it is used 
                as a baseline. As long as citizens are willing to believe a globe they are more likely
                to believe whatever else they are told, as long as a resonable amount of evidence is forged.

                We have to wake up and look closer at what we are being taught. More importantly, we have to
                do our part and teach our children to question authority and learn how to test the evidence
                supplied from an outside source to test it’s legitimacy.
